# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to 
Paquet! 🥳

Keep in mind that those are guidelines and not strict
rules that everyone should follow, that's why
this document is going to be very brief. You could go on
and contribute to Paquet without reading a word of this
document, but it's good to at least have a clue of how
things are working here.

## Branches

> Paquet is in the progress of switching from semver to 
git hash versioning for faster deployments and fixes.
This section is subject to change.

The `main` branch is reserved for production only. This
is the branch that gets deployed to production.

The `next` branch is used for the next major version.
This branch can also be used for the next minor version
in case there are no plans yet for a major version release.

## Issues

It is preferred to use the issue templates but it's not mandatory.
Those issue templates are made for you to have an easier time
creating the issue, not for me reading it.

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be made against:
* `main` in case of hotfix, doc change, config change
* `next` in case of improvement, bug fixes or anything else (so they are included in the next release ;))

Pull requests should be reviewed by **at least one person** so they can be
merged.
