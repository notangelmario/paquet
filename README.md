## 🧰 Tools

Paquet is built with a modern toolset in mind:

- [Deno](https://deno.land)
- [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev)
- [Twind](https://twind.dev)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)

## 🔨 Tasks

To cache all required dependencies:

```
deno task cache
```

To run the app in development mode:

```
deno task dev
```
> `deno task dev` will automatically download PocketBase for you and
run it concurrently with the app. The app doesn't work at all without
PocketBase running too.

To update apps:

```
deno task update [appId] [--force]
```

To manage dependencies:

```
deno task esm:[add|remove|update]
```

To type check, lint, and format the source code:

```
deno task check
```

## 📄 Developer Documentation

Developer documentation is available both on [GitHub](/docs/getting-started.md) and
[Paquet](https://paquet.shop/docs/getting-started)

Developer documentation teaches you how you can add your own app to Paquet or build an app using Paquet's APIs
